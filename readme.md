#Alchemical

A simple program for making files into patterns.

Compresses a file and represents the compressed data in a base 9 spiral pattern.

Requires Python 3.x

##Running

To generate an _alchemical circle_, run `python /path/to/circlegen.py /path/to/file/`

Alchemical will create an svg representing the file in the current directory.

##Aside

May add menu options, tidy code,  and make this a proper shell program in the future.
